    "\n",
    "A **decidable problem** is a decision problem for wich an algorithm can be writen to produce a correct output for all inputs(eg.”Is the number even?”) This is different from an undecidable problem which may have an algorithim that works, but it can never fully work, and there are always instances in wich that is the case to make a problem undecidable. \n",
