    "Heuristics in computer science are problem-solving techniques that provide ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù solutions when optimal ones are too complex or costly. They are essential for solving computational problems efficiently, especially with large data sets or when optimal solutions are expensive to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) curriculum, heuristics help students tackle complex problems where traditional algorithms may be inefficient. Here‚Äôs a guide to how the College Board defines and teaches heuristics:\n",

    "### 1. Nearest Neighbor Heuristic\n",
    "Used in problems like the **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**. The algorithm picks the closest unvisited location at each step. It‚Äôs fast, but not always optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Greedy Algorithms\n",
    "These algorithms make the best immediate choice at each step. A common example is the **Greedy Coin Change** algorithm, which picks the largest coin first. It works well in many cases, but not all.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Heuristic Search Strategies\n",
    "In pathfinding problems, estimates like **Manhattan Distance** or **Euclidean Distance** help search algorithms (like A*) find solutions faster by guessing which path is best to try next.\n",
