    "In computer science, **heuristics** are problem-solving techniques that simplify decision-making and find \"good enough\" solutions when an optimal one is too costly or complex to obtain. They play a crucial role in helping solve computational problems efficiently, especially in situations involving large data sets or when optimal solutions are computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) curriculum, the concept of heuristics is introduced to help students understand strategies for solving complex problems where traditional algorithms may be inefficient or impractical. Here’s a comprehensive guide to how the College Board defines and suggests teaching heuristics:\n",

    "<h4 style=\"color: #C71585;\">Sorting Algorithms</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristics help decide which sorting algorithm to use. For example:\n",
    "- **Insertion Sort** is chosen when dealing with small datasets, as it is simpler and faster for small inputs.\n",
    "- **Merge Sort** or **Quick Sort** is better for larger datasets as they have better time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4 style=\"color: #C71585;\">Searching Algorithms</h4>\n",
    "Heuristics like **A* Search Algorithm** combine actual distances and estimated distances (heuristics) to find the shortest path in a graph. The heuristic used helps estimate which path is more likely to lead to the goal efficiently.\n",

    "<h4 style=\"color: #C71585;\">Optimization Problems</h4>\n",
    "Heuristics are used when solving optimization problems where an exact solution is too slow to compute. For example, in the **Knapsack Problem**, heuristics like the **Greedy Approach** can be used to find an approximation of the optimal solution.\n",
