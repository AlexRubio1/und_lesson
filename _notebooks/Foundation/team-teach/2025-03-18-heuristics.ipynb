    "## Introduction to Heuristics\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, **heuristics** are problem-solving techniques that simplify decision-making and find \"good enough\" solutions when an optimal one is too costly or complex to obtain. They play a crucial role in helping solve computational problems efficiently, especially in situations involving large data sets or when optimal solutions are computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **AP Computer Science A** curriculum, heuristics help students understand and apply efficient problem-solving strategies for a wide range of coding problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Heuristic?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **heuristic** is a mental shortcut or rule of thumb used to solve problems. In programming, heuristics help guide decision-making, leading to quicker solutions without the need to explore all possibilities. While heuristics do not guarantee the best solution, they often provide a good-enough answer in a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Heuristics in Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Greedy Algorithms**: These algorithms choose the best available option at each step with the hope of reaching a global optimum. A classic example is **Greedy Coin Change**, which picks the highest coin denomination available.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Search Algorithms**: In pathfinding problems, heuristics like **Manhattan Distance** or **Euclidean Distance** are used to estimate the distance from the current node to the goal. These help improve search efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sorting Algorithms**: Some sorting algorithms like **Insertion Sort** are heuristically chosen for small datasets due to their low overhead compared to more complex algorithms like **Merge Sort**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Role of Heuristics in AP Computer Science A\n",
    "\n",
    "In AP Computer Science A, students are introduced to heuristics in the context of algorithms and problem-solving. Here are some ways heuristics come into play:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "Heuristics help decide which sorting algorithm to use. For example:\n",
    "- **Insertion Sort** is chosen when dealing with small datasets, as it is simpler and faster for small inputs.\n",
    "- **Merge Sort** or **Quick Sort** is better for larger datasets as they have better time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Search Algorithms\n",
    "Heuristics like **A* Search Algorithm** combine actual distances and estimated distances (heuristics) to find the shortest path in a graph. The heuristic used helps estimate which path is more likely to lead to the goal efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Optimization Problems\n",
    "Heuristics are used when solving optimization problems where an exact solution is too slow to compute. For example, in the **Knapsack Problem**, heuristics like the **Greedy Approach** can be used to find an approximation of the optimal solution.\n",
